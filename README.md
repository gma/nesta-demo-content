Nesta Content Demo
==================

**Note:** If you're reading these files on the GitHub site you'll find
that GitHub will automatically render the Markdown and Textile files for
you; click the 'raw' link when viewing a page to see the real markup.

The files in this repository are here to provide an example of how you
can add content to your Nesta site. It's not intended as a replacement
for the documentation; more as a handy example to help get you started.

You can explore these pages in your local Nesta site like this:

    $ cd path/to/your-nesta-site
    $ nesta demo:content

The `nesta demo:content` command will:

 1. Clone this repository into `path/to/your-nesta-site/content-demo`.
 2. Update your `config/config.yml`, pointing Nesta to `content-demo`.
 3. Tell git to ignore the new folder (if you're using git).

Your existing content repository will remain untouched.

You can see what the demo site looks like at <https://demo.nestacms.com>.
